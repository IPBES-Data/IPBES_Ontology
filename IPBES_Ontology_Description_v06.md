## 1. Introduction
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is the intergovernmental body which assesses the state of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services it provides to society, in response to requests from decision makers. To this end, it produces regular regional, national and global assessment reports in collaborations with many experts, scientists and politicians from a wide range of expertise, nationalities and backgrounds. To our knowledge, there is no existing ontology for representation of intergovernmental reports and the broad topics and information that they cover. To this end, we have created the IPBES ontology as the stepping stone for representing these types of data as LOD and make them accessible for further exploration.

## 2. Namespace Declarations
This is the list of the namesspaces used in this ontology.

| namespace prefix | namespace URI |
| --- | --- | 
| ipbes | <https://ontology.ipbes.net/report/> |
| foaf | <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> |
| skos | <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> |
| owl | <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> |

## 3. The IPBES Ontology Description
The classes and properties used in IPBES ontology are created on the fly based on the information that we encounter and the concepts that we aimed to represent. However, the usage of the properties is consistent and the coined URIâ€™s are stable and unique. Currently our ontology consists of 6 classes, each representing a specific part of the data along with their corresponding attributes.
