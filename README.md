<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## IPBES Ontology

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is the intergovernmental body which assesses the state of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services it provides to society, in response to requests from decision makers. To this end, it produces regular regional, national and global assessment reports in collaborations with many experts, scientists and politicians from a wide range of expertise, nationalities and backgrounds. 
To our knowledge, there is no existing ontology for representation of intergovernmental reports and the broad topics and information that they cover. To this end, we have created the IPBES ontology as the stepping stone for representing these types of data as Linked Open Data and make them accessible for further exploration.

The development of this ontology is still i progress. At the moment the datasets are available in TTL format by request. In near future an SPARQL endpoint will be also available to further faciliatte the exploration the datasets.
